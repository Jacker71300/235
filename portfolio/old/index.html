            <p id="bio">Hi! I'm Jack and I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Game Design and Development Student at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                I'm very interested in the level and encounter design aspects of the video games industry.
                I also have a large passion for music, especially in film and media.</p>

                <p>Color Roller is a game that was developed for the 2019 Games 4 A Cause game jam.
                    It was created over the course of 24 hours in November of 2019 and was created by a team of 4.
                    Color Roller is a physics-based, 2D puzzle game in which a player is given very minimal information on the mechanics of the game.
                    The levels were designed in order to help facilitate the learning of mechanics one at a time and then combined them into a more cohesive game.
                    Throughout the project, I was designated as the lead developer and focused on creating the core mechanics that every level was based off of.

                <a href="https://github.com/jzaia18/Grov" target="_blank">Github</a>
                <p>Gróv was a project that I worked on for about the length of 2 months in early 2019.
                    It is designed as a rogue-like, dungeon crawler that is procedurally generated on every playthrough.
                    I was the main designer and nearing the end of the development, I was then put on boss encounter design.
