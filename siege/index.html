        <hr>

        <p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege is a tactical first person shooter which bases it's gameplay off of real time destruction physics.
            Floors, ceilings, and walls can be breached in order to give one team a tactical advantage over the other.
            Players are able to choose and customize their characters from a variety of international counter terrorist units (CTUs).
            Each operator has a unique gadget that is used to determine their playstyle.
            These range from extra armor plates to soak up damage, to headgear that allows you to see and track footprints.

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <hr>
    <blockquote>"Most tactical games take a while to get there: the tipping point where I’m no longer struggling with controls, communication, or match flow. 
        After the first match in a typical game of Siege, I know my role, my team and I have developed a relationship, and we’re settling into a unique rhythm. 
        For a game with so many branches of complexity and potential, Siege is the only shooter I know that encourages such tactical depth, player expression, and creative teamplay. 
        It’s a game that wastes no time getting to the primal, creative, social, everything core of what makes competition so much fun."<br>
