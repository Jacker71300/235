## I. Gameplay Mechanics

Players will start the game with an undetermined amount of points which they can spend on towers to protect their base.
Players will then be able to spawn a wave of enemies which will become progressively harder as the wave number increases.
Between and during rounds, players will be able to purchase more towers and upgrade existing towers using the points they have accumulated.
Points will be earned by defeating enemies with stronger enemies rewarding inreasing amounts of points based off of their difficulty.

## II. Enemy Mechanics

Enemies will spawn on the left side of the screen and make a break for the player's base on the right side of the screen.
The enemies will approach the base and repeatedly attack it upon reaching the walls.
Enemies will spawn as different types of classes including a medium-health, medium-speed generic enemy, a high-health, low-speed tanky enemy, and a high-speed, low-health, fast enemy.
Enemy types will become more and more diverse as the wave number increases with the game starting only with generic enemies.

The enemies will all reward different amounts of points based on their lethality and toughness.
